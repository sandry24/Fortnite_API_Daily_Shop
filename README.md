# Fortnite API Daily Shop script
Object-oriented approach to a Fortnite daily shop tracker. Create an API key on https://dash.fortnite-api.com/account, store it in "api_token.py" and just run "main.py". Modify the behaviour of the output in "shown_types.py". At the end of the output there are alerts for free items and wishlisted items added to "wishlist.py".
